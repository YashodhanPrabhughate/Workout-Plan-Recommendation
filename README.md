## Dataset

- The dataset used in this project consists of [briefly describe the dataset, e.g., user demographics, dietary preferences, workout history, etc.].
- It can be found [mention where the dataset can be accessed or if it is provided in the repository].

## Model Training

- The model is trained using [mention the algorithms used, e.g., decision trees, random forest, neural networks, etc.].
- Training involves [briefly describe the training process, e.g., feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, etc.].

## Evaluation

- The model's performance is evaluated using [mention metrics, e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.].
- Results and evaluation metrics are stored in the `output/results` directory.

## Results

- [Provide a summary of the results obtained from the model evaluation, including any graphs or tables generated.]
